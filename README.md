# Claude Code Templates

The intention with this repository is to share CLAUDE.md templates that I found useful in my own AI-driven development.

To use these templates, I'd recommend choosing a CLAUDE-*.md file, giving it to Claude, and asking it to contextualize within your project and update the projects CLAUDE.md.
